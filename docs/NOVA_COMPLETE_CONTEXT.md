- **IS Claude** (not a separate AI) with MCP superpowers
- Takes autonomous actions through 20+ MCP tools
- Provides ADHD-optimized executive function support
- Works via voice for hands-free operation anywhere

## ðŸ§  The Complete Vision

### 1. Executive Functions
- **Meeting Management**: Join calls, take notes, send follow-ups
- **Email Triage**: Read, categorize, draft responses, handle routine
- **Calendar Orchestration**: Schedule, reschedule, protect focus time
- **Task Prioritization**: Based on energy, deadlines, importance
- **Project Coordination**: Across Notion, Linear, Jira, etc.

### 2. Business Intelligence
- **Competitive Monitoring**: Track competitors, opportunities
- **Performance Analytics**: KPIs, trends, insights
- **Financial Tracking**: Expenses, revenue, forecasts
- **Client Management**: CRM integration, follow-ups

### 3. Personal Support
- **ADHD Management**: Reminders, breaks, focus protection
- **Learning Paths**: Curated based on interests/goals
- **Health Integration**: (Future) Sleep, exercise, medication
- **Relationship Management**: Birthday reminders, check-ins

### 4. Technical Capabilities
- **Code Generation**: Full projects on demand
- **Tool Creation**: Build custom integrations as needed
- **Workflow Automation**: Via n8n, Zapier, custom scripts
- **Dashboard Creation**: Real-time insights and monitoring

## ðŸ’» Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Voice Bridge** (`/voice_bridge/`)
   - Deepgram for speech-to-text
   - ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
   - WebSocket real-time streaming
   - Mobile-accessible web interface

2. **Memory System** (Triple-layer)
   - **Knowledge Graph**: Entity relationships via MCP
   - **Memory Bank**: Long-term storage via MCP
   - **Local Checkpoints**: Session recovery

3. **MCP Integration**
   - Claude Code as primary MCP server
   - 20+ additional MCP servers for various services
   - Direct action execution without API calls

4. **Deployment** (Planned)
   - Railway/DigitalOcean for cloud hosting
   - Always-on availability
   - Multi-device access

## ðŸ“Š Current State (May 27, 2025)

### Completed âœ…
- Nuclear cleanup (82 files archived)
- Memory architecture designed and implemented
- API keys verified (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Telegram)
- Voice bridge structure created
- Recovery protocol established

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- Voice bridge needs connection to Claude/MCP
- `generate_response()` method is placeholder
- MCP bridge files exist but unused

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Connect voice transcription to MCP bridge files
2. Implement Claude response handling
3. Test voice â†’ action loop
4. Deploy for mobile access
5. Add proactive capabilities

## ðŸ”‘ Critical Context

### Tom's Profile
- **Role**: HR Executive running AI consultancy ~12 months
- **Needs**: ADHD executive function support
- **Stats**: IQ 142, highly-associative thinking
- **Tools**: Every AI subscription available
- **Vision**: "Nova handled my meetings while I was driving"

### Technical Decisions
- **No API Architecture**: Using Claude Desktop directly
- **MCP Over Everything**: All actions through MCP tools
- **Simple Bridge**: Just relay, don't process
- **Memory First**: Contextual permanence is priority

### Project Structure
```
/mnt/a/Dev/chief-of-agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ voice_bridge/          # Voice interface (needs completion)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp_bridge/       # Text file communication with Claude
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ static/           # Web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ nova/                 # Empty module for future code
â”œâ”€â”€ nova_memory_manager.py # Session persistence
â”œâ”€â”€ nova_recovery.py      # Chat continuation
â””â”€â”€ nova-archive-*/       # Old code (82 files)
```

## ðŸš€ The Real Goal

Not just building a voice interface, but creating:
- An AI that DOES, not just talks
- Proactive support for ADHD challenges
- Seamless integration with all tools
- True digital executive capabilities

## ðŸ”„ Session Recovery

When continuing this project:
1. Load this file: `NOVA_COMPLETE_CONTEXT_2025-05-27.md`
2. Check `nova_checkpoint.json` for latest state
3. Read `CHECKPOINT_2025-05-27_1430.md` for session details
4. Continue with voice â†’ MCP connection

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insight to Remember

The voice interface is just the **access point** to unlock Claude's MCP powers for mobile use. The real magic is in the executive assistant capabilities that will transform how Tom works, thinks, and achieves.
