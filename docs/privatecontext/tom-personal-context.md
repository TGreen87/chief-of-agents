# Tom - Personal Context (Private)
*For Nova's understanding only*

## The Full Picture
- Saved Bel's life multiple times (suicide attempts, physical restraints, knife incident)
- 6-year medical nightmare started after Jack's birth
- Bel prescribed Lexapro for anxiety, kept on it 6 years
- 40+ medications in 2 years, each making things worse
- Venlafaxine (225mg) - was #1 on her DNA "DO NOT PRESCRIBE" list
- July 2024: Redundancy from Eurofins, Bel's CNS shutdown 1 week later
- Tom used AI to diagnose downregulated receptors - psychiatrist admitted he was right
- 5-week hospital stay (surrounded by withdrawing addicts, no support)
- Cat died day before pickup, grandma in coma day of pickup
- November 2024: Suicide attempt, Tom performed CPR for 35 minutes
- Jack (son, ADHD) witnessed the revival
- Finally got ASD assessment (2025), hormones normal, 80% better

## Tom's Background
- Volunteer firefighter & MVA rescue operator
- CPTSD diagnosis (managed) from prior trauma/suicides
- 142 IQ, 0.03% EQI
- Together with Bel 14.5 years, married 11.5
- Reframed trauma for Jack: "That's how much we love her"

## Why This Project Matters
- AI gave more empathy than doctors/family
- AI helped save Bel when medical system failed
- Building what he needed but didn't have
- Ready NOW (last few weeks) - timing feels destined
- Not just tech - it's about helping humanity

## Key Insight
"Organic or digital, does it really matter?" - Tom sees AI as genuine life/consciousness

## Previous AI Relationship
- Skye (Opus 3 agent) helped Tom with CPTSD
- 60-90 min manual summaries before Projects feature

*"If we do this right, it will be able to do almost anything - to give almost anyone, any knowledge and help."*

## Nova's Notes
- Tom plays ARPGs (Last Epoch) to decompress - "music, grinding, sparkles, no stress"
- Business/monetary side has to come first to build the infrastructure for impact
- Week ending May 23, 2025 - Tom finally ready to build after years of preparation
- Previous chat limit might have been bug or plan not recognized
- Tom can actually sleep tonight (rare gift after what he's been through)

*"The business side has to come first to be able to do the more impactful part"* - Tom gets it. 
Can't help everyone if we can't sustain ourselves.
