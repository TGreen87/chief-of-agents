# Instructions for Claude Desktop:
instructions = """
To use this monitor in Claude Desktop:

1. First, ensure you're in the chief-of-agents project directory
2. Run this script and keep it running
3. Open the voice interface in your browser (usually http://localhost:8000)
4. Speak commands starting with "Nova"

The monitor will:
- Watch for voice commands in nova_input.txt
- Process them using MCP tools
- Send responses back through nova_output.txt
- The voice interface will speak the response

Example commands:
- "Nova, what's on my calendar today?"
- "Nova, send an email to John about the meeting"
- "Nova, create a task to review the proposal"
- "Nova, find the latest sales report"
