# Checkpoint: MCP Bridge Implementation Complete
**Date**: 2025-05-28
**Session**: MCP Bridge Connection Implementation

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup ✅
- Created public repository: https://github.com/TGreen87/chief-of-agents
- Configured authentication with fine-grained PAT
- Initial commit with all project files
- Continuous backup established

### 2. MCP Bridge Implementation ✅
- **MCPBridgeHandler** (`mcp_bridge_handler.py`)
  - File-based communication with request/response pattern
  - Unique request IDs for message tracking
  - File locking to prevent race conditions
  - 30-second timeout with automatic cleanup
  
- **Voice Bridge Updates** (`voice_bridge.py`)
  - Replaced placeholder with actual MCP bridge integration
  - Maintains conversation context
  - Handles errors gracefully
  
- **Monitoring Scripts**
  - `nova_mcp_monitor.py` - General monitoring template
  - `claude_desktop_nova_bridge.py` - Claude Desktop integration

### 3. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive MCP Bridge Implementation Guide
- Documented message formats and usage instructions
- Added troubleshooting section

## Current Architecture

```
Voice → Deepgram → nova_input.txt → Claude Desktop → MCP Tools → Real Actions
                                            ↕
                                    nova_output.txt
                                            ↓
                                    ElevenLabs → Speaker
```

## How to Use Nova Now

### Quick Start:
1. **Terminal 1**: Start voice interface
   ```bash
   cd voice_bridge
   python voice_bridge.py
   ```

2. **Browser**: Open http://localhost:8000

3. **Claude Desktop**: 
   - Copy contents of `claude_desktop_nova_bridge.py`
   - Paste and run in Claude Desktop
   - Keep running

4. **Speak**: Click "Start Recording" and give commands

### Example Commands:
- "What's on my calendar today?"
- "Send an email to the team about tomorrow's meeting"
- "Create a task to review the Q4 report"
- "Find the latest project documentation"

## Technical Details

### Message Flow:
1. Voice → Deepgram transcribes to text
2. Text written to `nova_input.txt` with unique ID
3. Claude Desktop monitor detects new request
4. Processes with MCP tools
5. Writes response to `nova_output.txt`
6. Voice bridge reads response
7. ElevenLabs converts to speech

### Key Features:
- File locking prevents corruption
- Request IDs prevent duplicate processing
- 30-second timeout prevents hanging
- Context maintained across conversation

## What's Next

### Immediate Testing Needed:
1. Test full voice → action loop
2. Verify MCP tool integration
3. Test error handling scenarios

### Future Enhancements:
1. Cloud deployment for mobile access
2. Enhanced command recognition
3. Multi-user support
4. Response streaming for faster feedback

## Project Status Summary

✅ **Completed**:
- Architecture design
