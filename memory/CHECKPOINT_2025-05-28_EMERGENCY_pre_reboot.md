# EMERGENCY CHECKPOINT - Pre-Reboot
**Date**: 2025-05-28
**Reason**: Claude Desktop went nuts redesigning, system needs reboot

## Critical State Information

### What Happened
- Attempted to test MCP bridge connection
- Claude Desktop started redesigning things unexpectedly
- System became unstable
- Need to reboot to recover

### Current Implementation Status

#### Completed Work (Still Valid):
1. **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/TGreen87/chief-of-agents
2. **Voice Interface**: Working with Deepgram + ElevenLabs
3. **MCP Bridge Handler**: File-based communication implemented
4. **Documentation**: All guides created

#### Files Created/Modified Today:
- `/voice_bridge/mcp_bridge_handler.py` - Core bridge logic
- `/voice_bridge/nova_mcp_monitor.py` - Monitoring template
- `/voice_bridge/claude_desktop_nova_bridge.py` - Claude Desktop script (MAY NEED REVISION)
- `/voice_bridge/voice_bridge.py` - Updated to use MCP bridge
- `/docs/MCP_BRIDGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation guide

### Problem Analysis

The issue likely occurred because:
1. The bridge script may have triggered Claude Desktop's code generation
2. File watching might have created a feedback loop
3. The script format may not be suitable for direct execution in Claude Desktop

### Recovery Plan After Reboot

1. **DO NOT** run the bridge script directly in Claude Desktop yet
2. **Consider Alternative Approaches**:
   - Manual copy-paste testing first
   - Simpler command format
   - External automation tools
   - Browser extension approach

3. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Test file writing manually first
   - Verify Claude Desktop can read the files
   - Start with simple text, not full scripts

### Alternative Bridge Approach to Consider

Instead of running a Python script in Claude Desktop, consider:
```
1. Use Claude Desktop's native file reading
2. Simple prompts like: "Read nova_input.txt and process the command"
3. Manual response writing to nova_output.txt
4. Gradual automation
```

### Git Status
- All changes committed and pushed
- Latest commit: c9c385b
- Repository is up to date

### Todo After Reboot

1. Test voice interface standalone (without Claude Desktop)
2. Manually test file communication
3. Redesign Claude Desktop integration approach
4. Consider simpler bridge mechanism
5. Document what caused the instability

### Critical Files to Preserve
- All files in `/voice_bridge/`
- All files in `/memory/`
- All documentation in `/docs/`

### Session Context
- Working on Nova AI Chief of Staff
- Tom needs voice access to MCP tools
- Bridge connection was the missing piece
- Implementation complete but testing revealed issues

## IMPORTANT: After reboot, load this checkpoint to continue safely!
