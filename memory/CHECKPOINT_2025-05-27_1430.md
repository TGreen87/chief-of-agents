# CHECKPOINT: Nova Project State
## May 27, 2025 - 2:30 PM AEST

### 🎯 Where We Are
Just completed a MAJOR cleanup and architectural clarification. The project is now crystal clear with a clean codebase and robust memory system for contextual permanence.

### 🧠 Critical Realizations Today
1. **I (Claude) AM Nova** - Not building a separate AI system
2. **Using Claude Max + MCP** - Not API calls
3. **Claude Code IS the MCP server** - Already working!
4. **Voice is just a bridge** - The intelligence is me with MCP tools

### 📊 What We've Accomplished

#### 1. Nuclear Cleanup ✅
- Started with 82 confusing files
- Archived everything to nova-archive-2025-05-27/
- Clean slate with only essentials

#### 2. Fixed Technical Issues ✅
- Fixed ElevenLabs API key (removed '6' prefix)
- Verified all API keys in .env
- All voice SDKs installed and ready

#### 3. Memory System Implemented ✅
- **Knowledge Graph**: Entities (Tom, Nova, chief-of-agents) with relationships
- **Memory Bank**: Active context saved as nova-active-context.md
- **Local Checkpoint**: nova_checkpoint.json for quick recovery
- **Recovery Script**: nova_recovery.py for seamless continuation

#### 4. Architecture Clarified ✅
```
Voice (Mobile/Desktop) → Simple Bridge → Claude/Nova → MCP Tools → Real Actions
```

#### API Keys Status
- ✅ DEEPGRAM_API_KEY (working)
- ✅ ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (fixed - sk_ prefix)
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY (present)
- ✅ TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN (ready)

#### MCP Servers Active
- claude-code-chief (file operations)
- knowledge-graph (relationships)
- memory-bank (persistence)
- 20+ others available

### 🚀 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Build Minimal Voice Bridge**
   - Use Deepgram for accurate transcription
   - Simple display/relay to Claude Desktop
   - Test voice → action loop

2. **Deploy for Mobile Access**
   - Need voice access from phone
   - Telegram bot or web interface
   - Real-time processing

3. **Connect First MCP Action**
   - Start with something simple (maybe calendar check?)
   - Prove the voice → Claude → MCP → action loop
   - Build confidence with working demo

### 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

1. **No API Architecture** - Using Claude Desktop directly
2. **MCP Over Everything** - All actions through MCP tools
3. **Simple Bridge** - Just relay voice to Claude, not complex processing
4. **Memory First** - Contextual permanence is priority

### 💭 Tom's Context
- HR Executive running AI consultancy for ~12 months
- ADHD - needs executive function support
- IQ 142, highly-associative thinking
- Has every AI subscription
- Vision: "Nova handled my meetings while I was driving"
- Wants AI that DOES things, not just talks

### 🎬 How to Continue This Session

When you hit the chat limit:

1. Start new Claude Desktop chat
2. Say: "I'm Tom, continuing Nova. Load CHECKPOINT_2025-05-27_1430.md"
3. I'll load:
   - This checkpoint
   - nova_checkpoint.json
   - Knowledge Graph context
   - Memory Bank files
4. We continue exactly where we left off!

### 📝 Critical Notes

- **Working Directory**: /mnt/a/dev/chief-of-agents
- **MCP Server Name**: claude-code-chief
- **Memory Systems**: All initialized and working
- **Next Task**: TBC

### 🔥 The Vision
Building the future of AI interaction - voice-activated AI executive that takes real actions through MCP tools. Not another chatbot, but an AI that DOES.

### Last Words Before Context Limit
The foundation is solid. Memory systems are working. Architecture is clear. Ready to build the voice bridge that will unlock everything.

When you return, we pick up right here. The dream of "Nova handled my meetings" is within reach!
